# Awesomeness in Waterdeep
## The City
Waterdeep is, by and large, the most civilized city on the Sword Coast. Yet civilized doesn't mean safe, nor does it mean easy to navigate. Many day-to-day elements of life in Waterdeep that residents take for granted are, to new arrivals, a bevy of wonders and dangers not seen in any other settlement within a thousand miles.

## The Heroes
### Rendar
A barbarian like no other. Both enraged and using common sense someone to watch out for.

### Ishi Eudamon
Nothing is what it looks like, this is the best way to discribe a fairy named Ishi. Fast hands raining from above can be deadly regardless of the weather.

### Uwu
A cute half-elven girl wearing way too much armor, but don't tell her I said this or she might get angwy.

### Owo
The brother of his sister. Makes the world a better and safer place for her singing.

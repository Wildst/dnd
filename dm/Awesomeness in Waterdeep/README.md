# Awesomeness in Waterdeep
## The City
Waterdeep is, by and large, the most civilized city on the Sword Coast. Yet civilized doesn't mean safe, nor does it mean easy to navigate. Many day-to-day elements of life in Waterdeep that residents take for granted are, to new arrivals, a bevy of wonders and dangers not seen in any other settlement within a thousand miles.

## [Puzzles](Tavern)

## The Heroes
### Rendar - Rip
A barbarian like no other. Both enraged and using common sense someone to watch out for.

### Ishi Eudamon
Nothing is what it looks like, this is the best way to discribe a fairy named Ishi. Fast hands raining from above can be deadly regardless of the weather.

### Uwu
A cute half-elven girl wearing way too much armor, but don't tell her I said this or she might get angwy.

### Owo
The brother of his sister. Makes the world a better and safer place for her singing.

### Dunga Gupta
A priest of a god that no one knows (yet), but considering the amount of effort that's put into it, this will change soon...\
If it's better this way, that's a question for another day.

### Nowhere
Even though he's Nowhere, he tends to be everywhere he needs to be. Seeing and feeling more than the common people see and feel... The dice gods seem to be font of him!


## Their Story
### Session 1 - 11/04/2022
**Flamerule 1**\
After enjoying some food and drinks in the Yawning portal, a couple guys gang up on a half-orc. With some help the half-orcs gets the better of them, when they grab a couple uncouncious mates, they flee as an alarm sounds signaling the arrival of a troll.\
The barman appreciates the help pushing the troll back where it came from, and a celebrity notices there bravery.\
**Flamerule 2**\
Trying to find his missing friend (Floon), they find themselves in a dark alley in the Dock Ward, ready to enter a warehouse Floon's kidnappers are known to be around.

### Session 2 - 25/04/2022
The first part of the warehouse consists of some dusty rooms with only suspicious tables and a paper bird inside. The big room is more interesting, as it's holding 4 kenku's and a dozen dead people as well ( probable big fight between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar's Guild). After killing most of the kenku's, a loud noise underneath the stairs takes their attention and reveals a big loxodon priest. Hiding in that same room is Renaer, who tells about the legends of a big stash of dragons somewhere inside the city.\
After some convincing the last kenku repeats some sentences and gives some information about where Floon might be (sewers, following the yellow signs). \
**Flamerule 3**\
After a good night rest, the paper bird is used to find the entrance to the sewers and gives more reason to believe that this is where Floon can be found. Who knows what will be hidden in these sewers...

### Session 3 - 16/05/2022
The sewers hold some dangers, like flying grapefruit with too many eyes to be pretty.\
After a little more time, a hideout is found in the middle of the sewers. Complicated tactics and different ideas make enemies unsure as they both got kicked down and healed at the same time.

While some are resting, others investigate a couple rooms behind a secret door. Let's see how this goes on...


### Session 4 - 23/05/2022
After a little rest, Rendar, Ishi and Owo are ready to go further. A hallway leads them to a bigger room, in the middle of which a muscular half-orc in dingy robes stands with his foot on the chest of a male human with wavy red-blond hair. Fire burns around the orc's clenched fist, and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him.\
Seated on a raised platform is a nightmarish figure wearing black robes. It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth. It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet.\
The nightmarish figure puts down the brain and glides across the room, leaving trough a double door. The half-orc and the brain focus on the new arrivals as a fight breaks out. After the half-orc goes down, the brain forces both Ishi and Rendar down, then it gets slightly bigger and disappears.\
Owo and Ishi wait until Rendar gets his counciousness back and explore the room a little further. They find what appears to be some kind of treasure chest. Ishi isn't honest about his findings, after which Rendar suddenly starts a fight to the death. \

Rendar is not Rendar anymore.

When the party arrives back in the Yawning Portal, Volo is already waiting, and happy to see Floon back alive. A Tiefling also joins the table, Nowhere followed the party on Volo's instructions to make sure they were not suddenly attacked from the back.\
As Volo hasn't finished his new book yet, he still is short on the promised cash and decides to reward the adventurers by giving them a remarkable property instead.

### Session 5 - 06/06/2022
**Flamerule 4**\
After waking up in the new house, Volo takes you to a magistrate to witness the transfer of the deed and make it officially yours.\
In the Yawning Portal, you talk to Jalester Silvermane, a field agent of the Lords' Alliance, who recruits you to help keep the city save. The first mission: "A gang war is causing unrest throughout the city, We have offered protection to members of the Dungsweepers' Guild, and you have been assigned to protect a group of them. Meet them at the Muleskull Tavern, on Ship Street in the Dock Ward, at six bells and guard them while they work. Do this every day for a tenday."

Going to bed early to be in time the next day.

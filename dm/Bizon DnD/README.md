#### The adventure begins
After an unfortunate accident with a wagon going towards Neverwinter, the party gets stranded together in Phandalin, where a quest board gets their attention. \
It's not easy to decide what to do, as all heroes have different backgrounds, goals and general opinions about life. Eventually they decide to go and get Adabra Gwynn, a midwife that lives in a windmill not far from town.

#### Umbrage Hill
After sleeping in the tavern, everyone gets together and the hike starts. When they arrive at the windmill, a large winged monster with a spiky tail is trying to knock down the windmill's front door. When approached, it becomes clear the creature is hungry and wants some food, instead of trying to get the boxed in woman inside the windmill, the 5 people walking towards it seem a way easier prey. But, it appears the visitors were actually even more helpfull, they went a little further into the field and managed to hunt down 2 goats and bring them back towards the creature. Even the sneaking and fighting with the food was not necessary this way.

Thankfull for dealing with the danger, Adabra Gwynn gives them a health potion, but doesn't want to go with them to Phandalin. The party does not give up easily, doesn't even give up at all to be fair. Eventually they get her so far to go with them to Phandalin, even though it's only for a short while. \
Glad there is no need for a set up romance, the heroes get their reward coin by coin and leave immediately to warn some dwarves.

#### Dwarven Excavation
When the party arrives at a canion, the sun is almost ready to set. They arrived just in time to find 2 dwarves (Dazzlyn and Norbus) sitting outside eating their dinner rations. The dwarves are happy to see them and tell them they are scared of a weird slimy creature inside and ask to make sure everything is safe inside, they offer a couple of [Sending Stones](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sending-stones) if they do so. Bravely the heroes agree to help and approach the creatures. A conversation with these things does not seem to be a feasible option, as they get attacked immediately. The good hearted Grotilda did stand a little too close trying to go for a peacefull approach and lost her life because of it. May she rest in peace. Apart from having hard hits, the creatures are also hard to hit correctly, a couple of good ideas only increased the danger they faced. Altough it was a close call for Hlin as well, there were no more casualties.

What more secrets are hiding inside those ruins, and what will they do with the body of their (recently met) companion?

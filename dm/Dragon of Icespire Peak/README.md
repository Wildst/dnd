# Dragon of Icespire Peak
This is my take on a follow-up adventure for the Dragon of Icespire Peak adventure covered in the Essentials Kit.

## Short summary of lvl 1-6
A small village gets terrorized by a white dragon. A group of adventurers helps out by doing some quests that are now too dangerous for the common folk.
While doing these quests they learn that some orcs and half-orcs have been driven out the mountains by the dragon and are now doing shady things in the forest, luckily they were able to stop them before they were finished, leaving only some destruction behind.

It took them hard work and some loss of life but 4 heroes, together with a 5th who helped them along the way managed to survive the threats and get rid of this dragon.

## Adventure
### 14/01/2022 - Session 21
The party awakes and goes to collect some last memories of the dragon, while traveling back to Phandalin they came across some basilisks, but this wasn't a problem at all.

Once back in Phandalin, the people are happy about the dragon being gone and start preparing a party. At this party an archery competition was won by Levi, and the singing/talent competition was Aislings.

At the end of the festivities 2 dragonborns came from neverwinter to accuse them of killing a dragon and try to get them never to do this again. Rohan assures them he'll keep it in mind but will do whatever it takes to defend the common folk.

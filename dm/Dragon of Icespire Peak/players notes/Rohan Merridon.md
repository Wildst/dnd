New session:
Rohan went to buy a shield and sold his handaxe. Wants to buy a better weapon, but needs money.
Found a longsword stuck in a dragons skull. Fought an invisible thing. Xinbjor and Rohan went down after trying to fight while running. Xinbjor died and Rohan is unconsious.

New session:
Rohan grabs the longsword, the arrows and the crappy bow and the shovel. Heading towards the woods. Aisling starts changing almost a full moon. Found a burnt tree with magic dolls in it and found a elf like being with a mechanical panther and mataku (dont call it mush)(lizardfolk). Fighting dolls that are hanging in the tree that make roots come out of the ground. Went to a place with xant the centaur and came up on a place with a sort of ravine in the middle. Fought orcs and a spellcasting half orc. About to go to a ritual cirkel.

New session:
Aisling turned full rat and attack the group, group downed her and she turned back. Aisling woke up in a pool of blood with no HP. Party got attacked by wererats with crossbows. Aisling got taken by the wererats Azalya tried following. (She sacrified a long rest for this). Party continues quest and then starts searching for Aisling. Party succesfully killed half orcs. Party fought and killed thunder boar, nobody died.

New session:
Explored the catacombs, Party started heading towards the expected location of Aisling, fought a giant ape while having a rest. (again nobody died). Found Aisling, freed her, fought the wererats while fleeing. Levi and Rohan created webs and thorns to keep the rats in place and then  Aisling and Azalya created fire, causing mass destruction. Went exploring and found a poisonous worm, killed it. Found darkvision goggles. Aisling does not know anything yet about her wererat condition.

New session:
We had a good night sleep and had some food in the mines, then decided to head back to phandalin to sell some stuff. Levi got help from Aisling to sell stuff, and dumped his total scrap inventory. Alexa started listing random stuff. Mush/Mataku/undulata is taking bread and weapons from the stores, and we try to keep her from doing that. Heading to Axeholm. Went into the fortress via the chimney and attacked a group of giant spiders. Cleared out the top floor except one weird not natural tunnel. About to explore the tunnel and still have to check the ground floor.

New session:
Got through the tunnel, lead to the first floor, found one of the mechanism to open te gate. Fought some gouls. Raised the gate and removed the barricade of the front door (didnt open). Went exploring furhter and fought more gouls and a banshee elven ghost. Everybody failed a save and fell to 0 HP, Levi imediatly got back to 1 HP. The rest eventually got healed aswell. Killed the gouls, but the banshee went through a wall.

New session:
Explored the remainder of the bottom floor, Levi got a interesting stone. Found a metal koffer and an amulet on a chain. Decided to have a long rest outside of the fortress. Fought a giant that threw stones at us. Rohan shot arrows at it since it was far away, got knocked unconsious and once almost died instantly. After some healing, the party went back inside and fought the banshee. The party then went exploring and found some gauntlets and a helm that makes your eyes glow red.

New session:
Arrived in phandalin, after a rest, orcs were in town. We killed the orcs, mush took out the hearts and placed them on the table in the inn. We tried hunting down the dragon, dragon found us and tried to attack us (slammed into the front door of the fortress). Rohan spoke with it and it went away. While tracking the dragon, we heard some arguing, and investigated. Found 2 giants both with 2 heads. Both giants did not do anything.

New session:
Went further on with exploring. Got to gnomengarde and talked with the king, dragon appeared in the area suddenly a few months ago. Mush ate some of the mushrooms and had some wild magic things appear. While tracking, we encountered a frozen ogre. Found some health potions in the sac of the ogre. While further exploring we found a stronghold which belonged to orcs. Decided to investigate the stronghold. Session ended when we arrive at stronghold.

New session:
Fortress is part of the Icepire peak, we entered the fortress encountered treasure hunters and eventually fought them after they started treathening us. Killed 3 out of 5, let the other 2 run.
Went exploring in the fortress and found the dragon on the roof sleeping. Trew necklace of fireball to the dragon and casted another fireball. Cause 5 wasnt enough. Everybody attacked, rohan went down twice because of the cold breath. Killed the dragon ðŸ˜Š. It called for its mother â˜¹. Mush cut off the head and take out its heart. Mush also took some claws and scales.

New Session:
Rohan inspects the scales and claws and learns the dragons scales are mostly white with a bit of grey. While camping on our way to phandalin we encountered 2 basalisks. Got back to phandalin and told the news of the death dragon. Stayed in the tavern and had some festivitities. Had a shooting competition, Levi won a +2 bow. Rohan joins a open podium competition. Aisling won a stone that can store a spell. A dragonborn came to us to warn us about not killing dragons cause they are mighty beasts. They wont listen to our answers. One dragonborn is called barash

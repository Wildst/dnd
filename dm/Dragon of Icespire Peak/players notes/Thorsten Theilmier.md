We teleported from a different encounter into a tavern, with most our stuff lost and feeling weaker.
People saw us drop out of the sky but didnt bother. Lord Mortis Grimmell teleported us out here, Delrick teleported our stuff to us. We are in the Yawning Portal. We are in Waterdeep. Monsters apear out of the crater in the tavern.

We did some shopping, where we got a map of the entire city.
We fought a troll and some sturges from the giant hole. A man called volothamp geddarm approached us, cause his friend got kidnapped. Friend is called Floon blagmaarr. Very Handsome male, early 30â€™s. Last location is called skewered dragon. He didnt have a debt as far as known.

New Session:\
We see three people getting arrested, they look like zenturim agents. There are a lot of corpses. Some clothes seem similar to the people that jumped the half orc last night. While taking a detour, we come across a purple shop with a stuffed beholder. Shop is called old Xoblob shop. We found the skewered dragon and asked the barkeep if he has seen that guy. Floon was talking to renawr neveramber. He is the son of the previous open lord of waterdeep. Which is like a mayor, the face of the city. Floon has been seen leaving with him and getting followed by 5 people who look like zenturim. Expected location of the zenturim is a warehouse on candle lane. We entered the warehouse, it looks abandoned. Inside the larger area of the warehouse we find 5 death people with the black snake and others with another tattoo that looks like a circle with eleven spokes. Fought some bird people and found renawr neveramber. Zenturim are looking for hidden gold, that they can find by a stone of colour, that belonged to the zalamar guild, but was stolen. They think Floon has it. Birdpeople were with Zanathar. He said pretty boy was in the backroom and follow the yellow signs in the sewer. We left the warehouse  going towards the sewers.

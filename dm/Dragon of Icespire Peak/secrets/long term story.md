# Long term plans

A couple chromatic dragons in the north want to lead the world under the supervision of Tiamat. As a preparation they have send out multiple young dragons all over the continent to extend their terrain (the defeated dragon was one of them).\
As a secondary line of defense, they are infiltrating some bigger cities (with dragonborns working for them) to collect the rumors in town regarding their spread out dragons. As a bonus they also attempt to frae those that slay a dragon as if slaying a dragon is a big sin.

On the other side, led by Bahamut, the chromatic dragons know that something is happening and are trying to find out what this is exactly and stop them.

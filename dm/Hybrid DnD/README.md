## The adventure

### Session 1: The adventure begins - 24/06/2022
**Marpenoth 1**

After a nice meal in the Yawning portal, a bar fight breaks out, most of the party members seem to enjoy this, be it by spectating and looking at the details of the fight, or by using it as a distraction for other plans.\
Just when it looks like the commotion is over, the bar empties out quicker than considered possible as an alarm goes of to notify the arrival of a Troll. Ofcourse the party has to play the hero and help the barkeeper to deal with this threat (which was appreciated). Their bravery did get noticed by more than only the staff. Volothamp Geddarm - A chronicler, wizard and celebrity (his words, not mine) - approaches the party and asks them to help him by finding his friend (Floon Blagmaar, a handsome human male with wavy red-blond hair). He was last spotted a couple of days ago in the Skewered Dragon (a tavern in the Dock Ward), where they did have a couple drinks together. Volothamp is worried as he hasn't heard from his friend since.\
In what condition do you think they will find him? If they find him at all...

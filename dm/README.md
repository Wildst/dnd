# Dungeon Master
Here you can find (some of) my preparations for the campaigns I dm.

If you are a player in one of my campaigns, this could contain spoilers so thread carefully.

Dm's looking for inspiration are welcome to take some parts as they see fit for their campaigns. Suggestions are always welcome, either trough pull requests or issues.

## [Dragon of Icespire Peak](Dragon%20of%20Icespire%20Peak)
My first dnd campaign as a DM, preparations are included starting at 7th level, as I ran the first 6 straight from the book.


## [Awesomeness in Waterdeep](Awesomeness%20in%20Waterdeep)
A campaign with some friends.

## [Hybrid Dnd](Hybrid%20DnD)
When collegues come together.

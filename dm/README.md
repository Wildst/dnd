# Dungeon Master
Here you can find (some of) my preparations for the campaigns I dm.

If you are a player in one of my campaigns, this could contain spoilers so thread carefully.

Dm's looking for inspiration are welcome to take some parts as they see fit for their campaigns. Suggestions are always welcome, either trough pull requests or issues.

## [Awesomeness in Waterdeep](Awesomeness%20in%20Waterdeep)
A campaign with some friends.

## [Hybrid Dnd](Hybrid%20DnD)
When collegues come together.

## [Bizon DnD](Bizon%20DnD)
Another fun campaign.

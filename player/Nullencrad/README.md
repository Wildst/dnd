## Story
### Intro
Welcome to the world of Nullencrad, it is the year 2043 and it is the age of exploring but what happened before that? Here is a short history of the world. 2043 years ago animals and creatures became the first races of the world and started banding together. Not all was well from the start, but they started working together and explore the world.

It was around 450 years after the manifestation of the races that gods came into play. The gods were the manifestation of emotions from the races. Because of this they stayed and wandered the world, while also working in the beyond to make sure the souls could get rest or reincarnation.

But all good times have an end and around the year 666 the dread war started. Abbominations and creatures of nightmare poured out of the bridge and the pits that connect the 2 continents. After a devastating war between the races and the pits, which are now called the endless abysses, peace was once again upon them, but for how long? They made defenses around the endless abysses for a time when they are needed.

Many years go by until something drastic happens. The sky shattered all around the world and new races came into play with a story that looked to be unbelievable. Coming from a destroyed universe and being the only survivors because of a small child? That wasn’t all, their arrival brought out the Towers. Even now we still don’t know what they really do.

The only thing we know for certain is that after the first clearing the underground changed and the worms departed. After the fifth clearing The Endless Abysses became more active. So bad actually that we need to send extermination crews every month, but the common folk don’t need to know that so they can live in blissful ignorance.
And that brings us too today. Through the years some people gained a nobility status by doing great things for the world or the people around them and some by creating an empire of trade. Now many years later the political dance is one full of threats, powerplays, backstabbing and grand balls to show your wealth. Well not for all noble families, some families partake in these balls but are more about protecting the world or making it better.

Now you find yourselves floating in the air, when you suddenly fly forward with immense speed. The scenery infront of you goes by to fast to see anything, but some flashes you know…. Strixhaven, The Everlife Tree, The obsidian Cataclysm but there is a 4th.

Your speed drops instantly and you can see a group of adventurers fighting what looks like a combination of a drow and a squid, but that doesn’t interest you. No the giant crystal wall and a glowing blue, white and purple gem is what interests you. When you come closer you can see that you are not yourself, but a man with distorted face and nice green and golden clothes. The thing that stands out the most are the scars around his eyes… You see him taking out the crystal and disappear, but you stay behind… and the following scene plays out…

The drow squid shouts out “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE” with a frightened look upon his face. BOOM the room starts shaking and you see that the crystal wall that lost its crystal has a crack in it. The man shouts “ RUN YOU FOOLS IT WILL KILL US ALL” and he starts running, but all is to late when the world around you explodes and crystal shards cut into you. A gargantuan blue tentacle makes 2 of the adventurers instantly a smudge on the floor. Another just dies on the spot and turns into a husk. The squid drow himself got skewered by a sharp appendage that shot out of the tentacle and is picking up his intestines that are dripping out and you hear him say “I only wanted to save us…” and then he collapses. You can see the last of the adventurers being picked up by a colossal creature. You don’t see eyes in the face, but the horrendous smell of the breath takes you aback. The last thing you hear before you see the adventurer being eaten is “I… am… Insatiable…”. You get teleported back outside and see the man touching a weird glowing blob, while you are standing amongst the stars, and the last thing you hear is “There is no end to infinity”

You wake up shaking and in sweat and are wondering what the hell kind of dream that was…


### 02/09/2022 - Session 1: The case of the hidden prince.

**vrijdag 8 maart 2043**\
We meet in the common room of a palace filled with important people. We're hired to protect one of them, Elijah. It looks like he's way to important to help the world find peace.

Also, he doesn't want to tell anything about why he needs protection...
This guy is very secretive, but it looks like he wants to do good.

Apparently his ancestors kingdom was invaded by some rivaling kingdom that took over. Bart doesn't seem comfortable with his story.

Elijah is first in line to the throne, and others know as well.

He want to make a kingdom of piece again! Exactly what we need.

After some shopping and potion brewing we prepare for the party, Elijah will go as *Reginald Murian*\
He tells [Lea](npcs#lea) his name.

During the party, Bart makes things awkward. We go to the hallway to talk where we have to fight off some kind of worm.

One of the worms shoots something in Elijah.

The worms disolve in some red substance when killed. The substance disolves on contact, but a glass vial keeps it intact.

When trying to get the needles out of Elijah, I notice they get bigger. They need to get out as quickly as possible, but without the right tools, it's quite difficult. In the mean time, Bart and Selina get help.

The queen herself arrives and manages to get the needles out.

When we are done cleaning up and join the party again, people are dancing, while Flemming and Alkur are verbally fighting eachother.
Selina is going to check what they're talking about. Apparently it doesn't work that well to do it stealthy.

After seeing that Lea is occupied and dancing with someone else, Elijah sends a message to Alkur. This makes Alkur come over for a talk.

Alkur doesn't think the bankcrofts are after the attack, as they are missing some employees themselves and have adventurers out looking for them.
As none of the Mihshah are there, he thinks it's someone else, a new player showing up.

After resting up a little at the bar, we decide it's going to be better to go and sleep, all in the same room. As we almost fell asleep, we see a creature slowly creeping trough the window...

### 09/09/2022 - Session 2: What lurks in the night!
A very deep sleep.

### 23/09/2022 - Session 3: Mothman, Frogman, Childman?
**zondag 10 maart 2043**

For some reason the morning starts with us waking upp while Elijah is in the closet with a magical frog on his head.

There is an artificer (Gear) with us, apparently he did my job when I wasn't there and saved Elijah, must be a nice guy.

Gear has a cat, but not one of those evil things, it's a rather nice machinal cat. I know it's nice because it is carrying my bag for me.
For some reason Clycky raised his hammock, but still gives me more potion ingredients. *Long live the mage hand!*

We're back in the palace, I asked Gear to put a sadle on his cat for me, but he doesn't want to.\
When the others come back with some dirty dog, Elijah is ready to tell us the masterplan:

*He compliments us for the things we've done. To get back his kingdom, we need things that are very much available for the brave. We need to gather powerfull artifacts. The way he says it, it sounds like a great plan, so let's go! He promises wealth and power to those who help him. And obviously a peacefull kingdom as well.*

Sasha, Gear, and eventually Selena agree to help Elijah as well. Together we for sure can get peace happen!
We've become more than a group, we now are a **Fellowship**, no idea what that's supposed to mean, but it sounds promising.

Sasha tells her story:

*I was with my family, but the I left my family and went on an adventure with my friend, but then I lost my friend and now I'm here.*

After Elijah asks me, I tell them a bit about my past.

Selena's Story:

*My memory is still a little fogy from a child that sat in my memory, maybe it'll get better in a couple days, leave me alone until then please...*

Sasha's dog is called R2 Dog2. There is Snakespear Sasha's snake, Oscar (Elijah's owl). Gears cat 's named Felis. Kermit Tessa is Selena's magic frog.

Elijah takes out a treasure map. We decide to go to the local tower, the **Shadowfell Tower**, on normal difficulty.\
To prepare for this, Sasha dumps R2 Dog2 at some shop.

When we arrive close to the Shadowfell tower, I quickly stock up on some more arrows, and better armor and after we should be ready to go EXPLORE!!!

While we make sure everyone is on full strength, I make another healing potion.

After entering, it feels like the shadows of the plants want to hug us in a bad way. There also is a river filled with black water.

We decide to start going East. Together with Felis and Gear, we lead the way. Apparently the ways are dangerous, and I fall into a root filled hole.
Something is breathing into my back, I should try to get away quickly. On the tip of my toes, I get away from it and join the rest.\
Selena falls, hits her head, and finds a mystical chest! All very curious to what's inside, she finds 20 copper. Could be better, but could be worse as well.

A ghostly old woman approaches us quickly, She's leaving a trail of blood behind her. I go back to the middle of the troops, and ready an arrow. The sight is terrifying and scares me. She lets out a horrific moan and... \
I suddenly lay down on my back, and see Sasha pooring a healing potion into my mouth. I focus my forces, and quickly shoot an arrow. Maybe a little too quickly, as the arrow doesn't do as planned, the string slips of and my bow needs some repairs. The repairs will have to wait, there are more important things to do now, I take out the whip, run a little closer, and whip it with all I have in me, it's a decent hit for a whip, but seems to go trough the creature slightly. This doesn't seem to be the right approach. What else can I do... If the whip doesn't work properly, and the bow is broken, that leaves me with a scimitar and some handaxes as only remaining options. The handaxes are not my strong point, but using one of them together with the scimitar allows me to dual wield and might prove to be more usefull than this single whip. Luckily the others take care of it before it's time for me to go with the things I decided. Repairing the bow now is my top priority, who knows what else is lurking in the shadows.

Another amazing speech from Elijah allows us to regain some of our livelyness. Elijah keeps surprising us, he has some magic that heals us all back to be ready to go. We turn to the north now.

While we're walking forward, Selena vanishes behind us. Only a small black puddle remains behind. If she fell into that, we have no way to see how far down she went. She stays down longer than I'd like, Sasha casts a spell and an extremely bright light comes out of the water. A rope is lowered down into the hole, guided by stones, but Selena keeps going down quicker.

While the others do everything in their power to combine ropes to become long enough, and get Felis down the hole to go help Selena, I scout the area for dangers to keep everyone safe.

Selena looks at the end of her breath when she gets back up. She's covered in mud, but gets cleaned up with help of Elijah. We take some more precautions as Elijah tries to scan for magic as we're going forward.

Suddenly Sasha has gotten another weird new friend, it's called Silky and looks like something I've never seen before. Now she wants us to go to a dark place to find it's big brother Bilky. Silky doesn't seem to know much more than we do sadly. She does mention a scary cloak walking to the west.
Elijah says that in a fellowship, we have to trust eachother, which sounds like a good thing. So since Sasha believes trusting this creature is smart, we decide to help it and turn westwards.

Selena trips over a chest, this time, the chest does contain some goodies: 2000 copper coins, 2 minor healing potions and a crystal to get out of the tower instantly. Since Selena has shown some trouble getting out of things, she's the one who's keeping this crystal close.

Suddenly a big shadow falls upon us, as Silky shouts *Brother!*. The two of them find eachother, and retreat into the shadows. Some more copper and a shady egg is the reward we get for bringing them back together. How nice it is to do good things and even get rewarded for it! Who better to take care of the egg than Elijah himself? I wouldn't know, so even though Sasha really wants to get ahold of the egg, he should probably be the one to keep it safe. He's found out it's not dangerous, or at least not right now.

Sasha won't let it go and keeps arguing about the egg, luckily it seems like Elijah is not letting it go. While we are going, the cloak Silky warned about shows up, I feel some sharp mental pain as my brain gets a little blurry. The cloaks fase seems to look kind of like mine. I quickly shoot an arrow, but it just flies trough the cloak. Above the cloak is a nameplate: *Eater of memories*. When talking to it, it replies in my voice &#128560;. It lets us know that we are in the right place for power, but not for wealth. The face of the cloak changes into Sasha's face. But it is quickly changing between hundreds of faces. The nicest memory it has is one of eating a memory of a family holding eachother.

Trying out the whip on this creature, but it seems to be going trough as well. The cloak keeps saying weird things, but doesn't seem to be taking damage in any way. My head keeps hurting and the world starts going slowly. I'll go and retreat somewhat and look from a distance. Even the eldritch magic coming from Sasha's hands goes straight trough the cloak. As Selena shows a flower crown to the cloak, they wither and turn to ashes. My mind cannot comprehend everything that's happening anymore, but it looks extremely fascinating, even though I can tell it's not doing any good. The cloak is always hungry, but doesn't eat food, only memories. That's probably where the name came from! It wants peace, but apparently it does think that taking our memories away is peacefull. So even though it wants the same as I do, working together is probably not a good idea &#128533;. As the adults stand back, the others seem to be affected instead, al be it in a slightly different way. It doesn't like living things, and says it's not living itself, but also not dead. The longer it takes, the weirder it gets.

Elijah says it's time to stop fighting it, and that it's a riddle to solve. Gear proposes to use holy water, and as we've nothing to lose, trying it might not be the worst idea. I walk up to it, open up the bottle and poor it straight trough the cloak. It was just another waste of valuable resources.

The cloak wants peace, and quiet, but cannot sleep to get that for even a short amount of time. It must be hard to be in a state where you exist at all times, and see and hear all things that exist at the same time. I get that this creature is so tired, and wants the quiet, but killing all other things is not the solution that we can accept. I go up to it closely and look into its faces. It doesn't show it's true face to me, and also can't eat it's own memories. It doesn't even have any memories of it's own.

After a lot of brainbreaking thinking, especially since all of my thinking is feeling off, Sasha casts Darkness on the thing, which does make it disappear, finally. We get 50gp each, 2 healing potions, a teleporting crystal and a cloak of the traveler (sleep halved).

As we get rid of the cloak, a portal opens and we get back to the normal world.\
After getting out we scrape ourselves back together with some of Selena's music to guide us. This was exactly what I needed to get my brain back to work the way it's supposed to.\
Since it's getting late, our next goal is to find a place to spend the night. I propose sleeping in some tavern, but Elijah is worried about another attack, so he's not keen on sleeping in a public place where we don't have any extra protection, and might get others in danger.\
We decide to get back to the palace and sleep there somewhere. We need a big room where we can strategically fight. But maybe a barn is a better option, as there is a big field around where we can safely fight without disturbing the peace of the palace. We finally decide a big room will be where we'll sleep.\
Next problem, do we baricade the door and window, or leave our own exits open. Since we think it's going to target Elijah, the plan is for us to stand before him, but I don't like being close to the enemy, so I think I'll stick close to Elijah and only do that if it's actually necessary.

Some kind of red dragon is coming at us at high speeds, we'll see how this goes, I'm ready for it!


### 30/09/2022 - Session 4: The Blood assassins continue!
#### A late night fight.
A fight breaks out, as the dragon enters, Sasha bravely stands in it's way. Eventually the dragon manages to push her aside. I don't know how this dragon fits, and has room to fight us, but it does. Sadly, this mighty beast will soon not be anymore. Elijah's enforces his sword with magic and strikes together with a cold breath from Oscar. As Selena keeps insulting the dragon, I make use of the distraction to aim. The string tightens, and when released the arrow flies right over the shoulder of the Dragon. Missing a beast this big in a room this small feels awfull. I'll need to practce more soon.

The dragon turns towards Elijah and attacks. As expected. The creatures attacking us seem all to be focussed on him, and this one is no exception. I'll try to goad the dragon in an attempt to protect him from a distance. The cold out of Oscars mouth really hurts this beast. Looks like we found his weakness. Looks like even Kermit Tessa is trying to help save our soon to be king.
I ready my bow again, but pull slightly to hard. The string shoots off again. So much for goading the dragon.

Sasha tries talking to the dragon. Apparently he's named Razuk. Be prepared to rest in peace Razuk! That's what's coming for you for attacking us!

The dragon gets another big hit in on Elijah and shouts '*My job is done, goodbye*' while he flies away. A predator killing for more than food alone. One of the only things worse than a normal predator. He'll regret this.\
It looks like Elijah agrees with my feelings, as he conjures a hand to try and grasp the dragon. Unfortunately the dragon swiftly moves trough. Oscar get's ready to follow the dragon if necessary.

This time, luck is more on my side. I quickly run closer as I put the string back on my bow, put an arrow on it and shoot it. Finally it hits! As I jump right next to the window, he flies away at high speed, but my arrow hits it anyway. Then it goes hiding in the sewers. Let's hope we scared it enough to stay there.

The dragon did not seem to have the red dust that was visible on all other creatures, but still targeted Elijah. Very weird.
What's also weird, is that Elijah's wounds heal almost immediately. Selena wants to stab him to see how it works, but luckily she gets talked out of it.

*"Do you know the lands of Usmium Prem"*, asks Elijah, *"It's the kingdom north of here. My family once ruled the lands of Usmium Prem, the throne is rightfully my family's, it's rightfully mine. I believe the attacks are coming from the Misha family, who currently reign over those lands. Someone's targeting me, and probably my family. But luckily they're hiding at a safe place. The Misha family is a Yuan-Ti family that worked together with the Bancroft family. The Thunderdrifter family helped me, and now I have to find riches and powerfull items to get my kingdom back. You ask why those vial creatures are attacking me? It's someone powerfull trying to stop us. To reclaim my kingdom I need many things. The first of which is allies, of which I have a few already. Otherwise we need wealth and powerfull items, of which are luckily abundantly available in this world!"*
We agree to protect Elijah no matter what to help him reach this goal.

**Maandag 11 maart**
#### An important research goal

After a good night sleep, we go and eat some breakfast. Pancakes witih Carrots, that sounds like the perfect combination. As Sasha keeps trying to convince Elijah to give her the egg, he stays strong and keeps it safe himself.

Elijah enlightens us about some social queues.\
While we enjoy breakfast, Elijah goes to try and find more about the egg. We try to find out the perfect ratio of carrot to pancake, but can't quite figure it out yet. **This needs more reasearch.**.

After breakfast I go back to the bedroom and brew a potion quickly.

#### A new friend
*"Unlike most other eggs, this egg does not need a certain amount of time to hatch. It needs some sort of trigger in order to hatch."* says Elijah, *"Look."*. As he lays the egg on the table and pulls out his sword and makes a symbol in the air. The sword starts vibrating and some runes light up as he speaks some arcane words *"Ana Fatha Aghata"* and touches the egg. A protective magical force appears around it. It didn't protect the egg though, as it breaks open and a slightly bigger version of Silky comes out and wraps itself around Elijah. Hopefully this works as the protective barrier it looks like. Elijah can use some protection.

While talking to his protector (Who's now listening to the name **Benji**), some kind of shadowhead comes out of the creature and looks at it's conversation partner while repeating it's own name.

#### What's hiding in the sewers?
We decide to go towards the sewers to try and get rid of the source of the evil attacking Elijah. It should be pretty big and pretty strong, but we can handle it.

Sasha and Selena lead the way.
We enter the sewers. The roof is covered in bloody veins.\
After pulling the shortest straw, I enter the sewers first. Encouraged by the fact that Elijah believes in me, I set a good pace.

They stop me and tell me to go quietly, I try to do so, but apparently Selena doesn't see how good I am, as she tackles me and throws both of us into the water.
Now Sasha goes first.
The veins are spreading onto the walls as well. We should be carefull not to touch those, as they work as some kind of alarm.

After walking for a little while, we come across some cocons that contain juice that eats your arms.
When we go further, we see some worms (as we fought a couple of days ago) growing inside.

Investigation reveals a weird lady being on the left, Selena and Sasha are acting as if this is our target and she's really dangerous. At the right there are some creatures, of which the mighty Dragon. They appear to be performing some ritual around a big cocon.

We decide to go to the left, after walking for a little bit, we enter a big room. In the room there are 8 cocons and the weird creature in the middle, hanging down from tentacles of blood.

We spread out a little and get ready to fight. I'm glad Elijah's standing close to me. The preparation worked, I took my time to aim and hit it!

The creature awakes and sends a pulse trough it's veins towards me. Luckily I jump just in time to avoid it. Apparently the creature is called **Ofamire**.

Luck was in the favor of the good ones, as usual and we manage to kill it without any casualties. Once Ofamire is gone, everything starts withering down.

#### A noble talk.

Now that some evil is dealt with, we're going to look for more magic items and riches to have more resources to make peace.

We request an audience with the king (altough waiting in front of his room until he would come back from the bathroom does sound like a more effective and faster plan). The servant said the king isn't home, so we ask an audience with the prince instead.

We talk to the prince, who talks about going to the endless abysses, and says there are tons of powerfull things to be found there. He pays us for getting rid of the evil. It always pays off doing the good thing.

**Lvl 5**

#### Preparing for Peace

**Dinsdag 12 maart**
I start the day by making some potions and distributing them along.

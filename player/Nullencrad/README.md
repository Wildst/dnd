## Story
### Intro
Welcome to the world of Nullencrad, it is the year 2043 and it is the age of exploring but what happened before that? Here is a short history of the world. 2043 years ago animals and creatures became the first races of the world and started banding together. Not all was well from the start, but they started working together and explore the world.

It was around 450 years after the manifestation of the races that gods came into play. The gods were the manifestation of emotions from the races. Because of this they stayed and wandered the world, while also working in the beyond to make sure the souls could get rest or reincarnation.

But all good times have an end and around the year 666 the dread war started. Abbominations and creatures of nightmare poured out of the bridge and the pits that connect the 2 continents. After a devastating war between the races and the pits, which are now called the endless abysses, peace was once again upon them, but for how long? They made defenses around the endless abysses for a time when they are needed.

Many years go by until something drastic happens. The sky shattered all around the world and new races came into play with a story that looked to be unbelievable. Coming from a destroyed universe and being the only survivors because of a small child? That wasn’t all, their arrival brought out the Towers. Even now we still don’t know what they really do.

The only thing we know for certain is that after the first clearing the underground changed and the worms departed. After the fifth clearing The Endless Abysses became more active. So bad actually that we need to send extermination crews every month, but the common folk don’t need to know that so they can live in blissful ignorance.
And that brings us too today. Through the years some people gained a nobility status by doing great things for the world or the people around them and some by creating an empire of trade. Now many years later the political dance is one full of threats, powerplays, backstabbing and grand balls to show your wealth. Well not for all noble families, some families partake in these balls but are more about protecting the world or making it better.

Now you find yourselves floating in the air, when you suddenly fly forward with immense speed. The scenery infront of you goes by to fast to see anything, but some flashes you know…. Strixhaven, The Everlife Tree, The obsidian Cataclysm but there is a 4th.

Your speed drops instantly and you can see a group of adventurers fighting what looks like a combination of a drow and a squid, but that doesn’t interest you. No the giant crystal wall and a glowing blue, white and purple gem is what interests you. When you come closer you can see that you are not yourself, but a man with distorted face and nice green and golden clothes. The thing that stands out the most are the scars around his eyes… You see him taking out the crystal and disappear, but you stay behind… and the following scene plays out…

The drow squid shouts out “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE” with a frightened look upon his face. BOOM the room starts shaking and you see that the crystal wall that lost its crystal has a crack in it. The man shouts “ RUN YOU FOOLS IT WILL KILL US ALL” and he starts running, but all is to late when the world around you explodes and crystal shards cut into you. A gargantuan blue tentacle makes 2 of the adventurers instantly a smudge on the floor. Another just dies on the spot and turns into a husk. The squid drow himself got skewered by a sharp appendage that shot out of the tentacle and is picking up his intestines that are dripping out and you hear him say “I only wanted to save us…” and then he collapses. You can see the last of the adventurers being picked up by a colossal creature. You don’t see eyes in the face, but the horrendous smell of the breath takes you aback. The last thing you hear before you see the adventurer being eaten is “I… am… Insatiable…”. You get teleported back outside and see the man touching a weird glowing blob, while you are standing amongst the stars, and the last thing you hear is “There is no end to infinity”

You wake up shaking and in sweat and are wondering what the hell kind of dream that was…

**vrijdag 8 maart 2043**\
We meet in the common room of a palace filled with important people. We're hired to protect one of them, Elijah. It looks like he's way to important to help the world find peace.

Also, he doesn't want to tell anything about why he needs protection...
This guy is very secretive, but it looks like he wants to do good.

Apparently his ancestors kingdom was invaded by some rivaling kingdom that took over. Bart doesn't seem comfortable with his story.

Elijah is first in line to the throne, and others know as well.

He want to make a kingdom of piece again! Exactly what we need.

After some shopping and potion brewing we prepare for the party, Elijah will go as *Reginald Murian*

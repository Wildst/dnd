### Sharindlar

dwarven deity primarily known as the goddess of healing and mercy. Although dwarves did not hide their worship of her, they called her the Lady of Mercy among non-dwarves to hide another aspect of her identity. Much more important to modern dwarves than her healing role was the status of the Lady of Life as their patron of romantic love, courtship, and most of all, fertility

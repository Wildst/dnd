## The book
### The type of creatures that live in the Dark Dimension.
The Dark Dimension is inhabited by Yokaï, terrifying predators that come in many shapes and colors. You could say Yokaï are like curses, demons, devils all scrambled together who like to prey and torment weaker beings. Yokaï tend to congregate in areas with bone and stone structures or dark places and form groups to feel more safe against stronger Yokaï. They like to haunt weaker beings and place bets against each other cuz they have nothing else to do… That is until the Queen will prevail in her plans…\

There are 3 types of Yokaï: Yokaï soldiers; 3 commanders and the one ruling them: the Queen. More explanations on the different traits, feats of Yokaï in chapter 4.\
